        In this method, we can simply add CSS to the particular HTML tag using the style keyword.This way minute styling of the HTML document can be easily done without any hassles.

 

        But still, generally, this method of adding CSS is not advised as it can create confusion in the tags and thus decrease the readability of code. 
        
        Also, with this method of styling, you canâ€™t use quotations within inline CSS. The quotations will be treated as the end of style and therefore stopping the block of code.</p>
